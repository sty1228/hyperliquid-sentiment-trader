trader1sz,"There’s something bittersweet about this post. I’m finding it hard to articulate why.

If I had to put it into words, it’s that building what we have built with @bertcoincto over the last 10 months has been utterly gruelling. I know that doesn’t sound inspiring but I can’t begin to express what has to go on in the background to make a quality CTO work. It does come down to hard work, determination and utter belief.

What I mean by that is everything in crypto costs a LOT of capital. Where does capital come from? VCs typically, or cabal, or presale. Take away all of that, and what options are left? It’s YOU, as a holder and believer. It’s your hard earned capital. 

On the other hand, when you believe in something so strongly (and to emphasise my point/ trying to distract me, my dog is snoring next to me), that belief and drive can help you do incredible things. So on one hand, I have always thought the super power of $BERT was this. Purpose and fight. Differentiating ourselves from the norm. Showcasing belief through hard work.

Then I see this. Does that take away our super power? No is the answer. What you are offering here @a1lon9, is not only acknowledging communities who, after 10 months of fight, that they exist - but an opportunity. An opportunity to continue fighting and a much needed injection of monetary belief in what they are trying to achieve.

Memecoins have changed. They are tokenised communities, come together for a common cause in this mad world to make a difference. 

The keys you hold here, are never expected, but forever appreciated @a1lon9",2025-09-04 22:51:22+00:00,[],BERT,neutral

Ashcryptoreal,"EVERYONE’S CALLING THE TOP….BUT THIS SETUP SCREAMS $200K BITCOIN 

A lot of traders are turning cautious right now.

And what's the reason?

➬ Bitcoin failing twice at $124K
➬ Bearish divergence on RSI
➬ Recent MACD bearish crossover.

At first glance, these are valid warnings as they often signal exhaustion at the top.

But if you look deeper, they don't look like the cycle top.

Let me explain to you why 

► We’re still inside the Elliott Wave structure, and the chart shows we’re in Wave (5).

► Historically, this wave is the most explosive part of the cycle, the one that usually extends far beyond expectations.

► At the moment, Bitcoin is consolidating around $110K-$112K level. Price action is forming a falling wedge, which is often a continuation pattern, not a reversal.

► The key levels are clear: $109K as immediate support and $98K as the stronger major support. As long as these 2 levels hold, the broader uptrend is intact.

► Yes, the short term price momentum is looking bearish.

► RSI has made a lower high while the price has made a higher high. That’s a textbook bearish divergence.

► MACD has crossed bearish, which usually shows fading momentum.

► And the rejection around $124K has created a possible double top formation, with the neckline sitting right at $109K.

► If you only look at these three signals, it seems bearish. But Bitcoin has a history of invalidating these kinds of bearish signals during bull markets.

► Take January 2024 as an example. We had a shooting star candle, a doji, and a bearish MACD cross all at once.

► The market looked ready to break down but instead, Bitcoin ripped higher and pumped 70% in just 2 months.

What could cause a big rally?

➺ Looking at the macro picture will help overcome your permabear disease. The macro structure is still higher highs and higher lows.

➺ Until Bitcoin loses both the $109K and $98K levels, the bull structure isn’t broken.

➺ Even more important are the cycle models.

➺ Stock-to-Flow, log regression, on-chain data, and cycle comparisons, nearly 30 different models, all still show we haven’t reached the cycle top yet. Most point to a peak in early 2026, not now.

➺ Liquidity also backs this view. Rate cuts, incoming fiscal stimulus, and rising global M2 are all supporting risk-on assets rally in the coming months.

➺ Also, Bitcoin has historically topped at the peak of the liquidity cycle and that cycle still has room to expand.

Important levels For Bitcoin 

✦ Wave (5) projection: $160K–$200K by Q1 2026.

✦ Support levels: $109K and $98K

✦ That’s why I see the current setup not as a breakdown, but as a bullish consolidation inside a much larger wave.

Conclusion 

● Short-term risk signals are screaming bearish.

● But the bigger structure remains bullish.

● If $109K and $98K support level hold, the rally to $160K–$200K is still on the table.",2025-09-04 13:12:14+00:00,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0ATfAlWEAAI2q-?format=jpg&name=medium'],BTC,bullish

$XRP as I just shared in a recent post looks ready for a rally, $ETH looks primed as well for a move up to $4700 (has left behind equal lows, not sure if we will take them before or after the relief rally) and Bitcoin itself looks like we could get a push to 117k+ if we can hold here.

The built up lows in the chart below on $BTC are likely to be taken- that I am pretty confident about. What I am not confident about is if they will be taken BEFORE or AFTER this relief rally that seems to be brewing across the board right now.

And for this reason, I have decided to exit my short scalp in slight profits. I will instead now look to enter a long below 107.2k on a sweep of these built up higher lows OR a potential short somewhere above 117k. 

It's also worth noting if we clean up the lows below us BEFORE a relief rally that could mark our HTF bottom but if we instead move up for relief BEFORE taking the built up lows it could indicate a deeper pullback if/when we return for the lows after.
