TheWhiteWhaleHL,"Additional $1 Million USDC Bounty To Investigative Journalists Announced

I’ve been center stage in the fight against @MEXC_Official 's opaque and predatory practices. But my audience deserves more than to watch me become a single-issue person. There are far bigger battles ahead in crypto - battles about transparency, freedom, and what kind of system we’re building. There's also my firm commitment to educate and enlighten my audience in order to build a stronger, more profitable community. 

Let me also be clear: the existing $3.1M bounty remains firmly in place. That pledge is permanent. No matter the date, if MEXC ever releases my frozen funds, every cent of that bounty will be paid - because a promise is a promise.

But it’s time to pass the torch to the investigative journalists who do this work best. Which is why today, I’m announcing something new:

The $1,000,000 Investigative Journalism Award

A $1,000,000 award is now live for any journalist or newsroom who can deliver verifiable proof that MEXC is engaged in systemic practices of:

Freezing or seizing profitable accounts
Weaponizing Terms of Service to confiscate funds from ordinary, legitimate traders
Targeting successful traders deliberately

This is not about rumor or speculation. It’s about hard evidence:

Internal documents
Whistleblower testimony
Consistent case studies showing a deliberate pattern
Proof of consistent misappropriation of customer funds

Deadline: 60 days from this announcement. (November 1st, 11:59PM UTC)

 The Committee

The bounty will not be decided by me alone. A three-person independent committee will review and judge submissions:

I will be one member.

Two other respected, and neutral figures will be announced soon.

The committee’s ruling will be final.

 Multiple Submissions Rule

If multiple independent investigations qualify:

First to publish verified evidence receives 60% of the award.

Remaining 40% will be prorated among other qualifying investigations, based on significance, and originality.

Recycling or plagiarizing/paraphrasing someone else’s work = disqualified.

 Conditions

Who Qualifies:

Accredited or independent journalists with a history of published work.

Established newsrooms (mainstream or crypto-native).

Substack/independent writers qualify if they can demonstrate a credible body of prior journalism.

Anonymous or pseudonymous investigators may qualify if publication is verifiable and meets the standard of proof.

Evidence Quality Bar: Must be verifiable, sourced, and specific. Screenshots alone won’t cut it.

Scope of Proof: Must show a systemic pattern of wrongdoing, not isolated mistakes.

Publication Requirement: Findings must be publicly published (article, investigative report, exposé).

Proof of Origin: First to publish gets priority, but originality and depth matters.

Payout Terms: Reward will be paid in USDC within 7 days of committee approval. The committee will make its final determination within 14 days of the 60 day deadline. (which is November 1st, 11:59PM UTC)

Security Protections: Journalists and whistleblowers may redact sensitive details; sources may remain protected but must be verifiable.

Transparency: Once awarded, the committee will publish a public statement confirming winner(s) and payouts.

Journalists may contact the committee via email: mexcexpose@proton.me

The Call to Action

This award is not about me. It’s about truth. It’s about accountability. And it’s about ensuring that the crypto industry isn’t run from the shadows by unaccountable actors. 

I'm so convinced of what I know (that @MEXC_Official is engaging in a systematic freezing of profitable accounts / confiscation of funds) that I'm willing to offer $1M to see published proof. 

If you believe in this cause - tag your favorite independent journalists, crypto newsrooms, and investigative reporters. The torch is theirs now. Let’s see who has the courage to pick it up.

TheWhiteWhaleHL,"Where The White Whale parks stables on HyperEVM. 

Yesterday I posted the places I park idle stables to earn yield on Solana. Today I'll share where I park stables on HyperEVM - one of the best kept secrets. 

As always, no ref links - I have no incentive for you to use it. Just sharing for general knowledge.

How to get there? Most of us don't have stables sitting on HyperEVM. I personally get there by using @debridge 

I've found the best opportunities are bridging my USDC from whatever chain they are normally on to USDT0

You'll need to have a very small amount of $HYPE token to use for gas fees. 

Here's the following places I personally park stables, ranked by my total TVL:

https://app.hyperlend.finance/markets/0xB8CE59FC3717ada4C02eaDF9682A9e934F625ebb…

The rates on HyperLend have historically been very high. Recently lower (I'll pull some out today to maybe help that) probably due to the points farmers aping in. 

https://usefelix.xyz/vanilla-earn

APY on Felix is very good today. I'll balance some of my deposits on HyperLend over to Felix .

https://app.hyperbeat.org/vaults/usdt

Hyperbeat tends to be the most stable APY I've found.

TheWhiteWhaleHL,"I wanted to give a shout out to @DeFiCarrot  - this is how marketing in this space should be done. Not the shameless blasting of some ticker on someone's feed, but by real engagement and the offer to help. 

Yesterday I posted the current places I earn yield on my stables on @solana 

The community engaged and asked me if I've heard of this or that protocol, some of which I hadn't been aware of. I believe it was a @solflare ambassador/employee who mentioned @DeFiCarrot 

I then went on to show my audience how I pre-screen most protocols and used @DeFiCarrot as an example. 

Multiple team members at @DeFiCarrot started engaging with the post, but not in a pushy ""come buy my thing"" way. Simply an offer - ""hey we're here if you have any questions"" - offering themselves as an educational resource.

This is the right way to promote your project. By offering the one thing the crypto community needs the most of.

Onboarding. 

And because of that willingness to engage their community and offer onboarding - not pushy marketing - they've been rewarded. Happy to say today I aped in and deposited 7 figures into their protocol.

trader1sz,"There’s something bittersweet about this post. I’m finding it hard to articulate why.

If I had to put it into words, it’s that building what we have built with @bertcoincto over the last 10 months has been utterly gruelling. I know that doesn’t sound inspiring but I can’t begin to express what has to go on in the background to make a quality CTO work. It does come down to hard work, determination and utter belief.

What I mean by that is everything in crypto costs a LOT of capital. Where does capital come from? VCs typically, or cabal, or presale. Take away all of that, and what options are left? It’s YOU, as a holder and believer. It’s your hard earned capital. 

On the other hand, when you believe in something so strongly (and to emphasise my point/ trying to distract me, my dog is snoring next to me), that belief and drive can help you do incredible things. So on one hand, I have always thought the super power of $BERT was this. Purpose and fight. Differentiating ourselves from the norm. Showcasing belief through hard work.

Then I see this. Does that take away our super power? No is the answer. What you are offering here @a1lon9, is not only acknowledging communities who, after 10 months of fight, that they exist - but an opportunity. An opportunity to continue fighting and a much needed injection of monetary belief in what they are trying to achieve.

Memecoins have changed. They are tokenised communities, come together for a common cause in this mad world to make a difference.

Went back through my journals to find an entry I wrote during one of my many losing streaks, because I wanted to share it with a great friend who’s going through a rough patch.

I’ll share it here as well.....

Journal Entry:

No matter how much skill you build, how much information you gather, or how much discipline you cultivate, you will encounter setbacks. 

The goal was never to eliminate them. 

The real challenge is becoming the kind of person who remains whole when they arrive. 

Most people don’t break from the loss itself, they break from the story they attach to it. A red number on a screen, a failed deal, a missed opportunity....these are just events. 

But the mind is quick to turn them into judgments: “I am incompetent,” “I’ll never recover,” “I am defined by this mistake.” That’s where pain lives.

Strength is not avoiding failure, it’s enduring it without collapsing into self-hate. 

The market, like life, is ruthless in reminding us that identity cannot be built on uninterrupted success. If your sense of worth is tied to always winning, you’ll never last, because the moment you lose, you’ll lose yourself too. 

The path forward is to learn how to separate outcome from identity, so that a loss is simply data, not a verdict.

True resilience isn’t about protecting yourself from falling; it’s about training yourself to rise without carrying shame. And once you understand that, losing stops being a threat....it becomes part of the process that sharpens you.",2025-09-04 12:41:39+00:00,[]

Ashcryptoreal,"EVERYONE’S CALLING THE TOP….BUT THIS SETUP SCREAMS $200K BITCOIN 

A lot of traders are turning cautious right now.

And what's the reason?

➬ Bitcoin failing twice at $124K
➬ Bearish divergence on RSI
➬ Recent MACD bearish crossover.

At first glance, these are valid warnings as they often signal exhaustion at the top.

But if you look deeper, they don't look like the cycle top.

Let me explain to you why 

► We’re still inside the Elliott Wave structure, and the chart shows we’re in Wave (5).

► Historically, this wave is the most explosive part of the cycle, the one that usually extends far beyond expectations.

► At the moment, Bitcoin is consolidating around $110K-$112K level. Price action is forming a falling wedge, which is often a continuation pattern, not a reversal.

► The key levels are clear: $109K as immediate support and $98K as the stronger major support. As long as these 2 levels hold, the broader uptrend is intact.

► Yes, the short term price momentum is looking bearish.

► RSI has made a lower high while the price has made a higher high. That’s a textbook bearish divergence.

► MACD has crossed bearish, which usually shows fading momentum.

► And the rejection around $124K has created a possible double top formation, with the neckline sitting right at $109K.

► If you only look at these three signals, it seems bearish. But Bitcoin has a history of invalidating these kinds of bearish signals during bull markets.

► Take January 2024 as an example. We had a shooting star candle, a doji, and a bearish MACD cross all at once.

► The market looked ready to break down but instead, Bitcoin ripped higher and pumped 70% in just 2 months.

What could cause a big rally?

➺ Looking at the macro picture will help overcome your permabear disease. The macro structure is still higher highs and higher lows.

➺ Until Bitcoin loses both the $109K and $98K levels, the bull structure isn’t broken.

➺ Even more important are the cycle models.

➺ Stock-to-Flow, log regression, on-chain data, and cycle comparisons, nearly 30 different models, all still show we haven’t reached the cycle top yet. Most point to a peak in early 2026, not now.

➺ Liquidity also backs this view. Rate cuts, incoming fiscal stimulus, and rising global M2 are all supporting risk-on assets rally in the coming months.

➺ Also, Bitcoin has historically topped at the peak of the liquidity cycle and that cycle still has room to expand.

Important levels For Bitcoin 

✦ Wave (5) projection: $160K–$200K by Q1 2026.

✦ Support levels: $109K and $98K

✦ That’s why I see the current setup not as a breakdown, but as a bullish consolidation inside a much larger wave.

Conclusion 

● Short-term risk signals are screaming bearish.

● But the bigger structure remains bullish.

● If $109K and $98K support level hold, the rally to $160K–$200K is still on the table.",2025-09-04 13:12:14+00:00,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0ATfAlWEAAI2q-?format=jpg&name=medium']

CredibleCrypto,"Right so we've been holding up at local range highs for some hours now and other alts are looking quite perky here. 

$XRP as I just shared in a recent post looks ready for a rally, $ETH looks primed as well for a move up to $4700 (has left behind equal lows, not sure if we will take them before or after the relief rally) and Bitcoin itself looks like we could get a push to 117k+ if we can hold here.

The built up lows in the chart below on $BTC are likely to be taken- that I am pretty confident about. What I am not confident about is if they will be taken BEFORE or AFTER this relief rally that seems to be brewing across the board right now.

And for this reason, I have decided to exit my short scalp in slight profits. I will instead now look to enter a long below 107.2k on a sweep of these built up higher lows OR a potential short somewhere above 117k. 

It's also worth noting if we clean up the lows below us BEFORE a relief rally that could mark our HTF bottom but if we instead move up for relief BEFORE taking the built up lows it could indicate a deeper pullback if/when we return for the lows after. 

Now we wait for either 107.2k or 117k+ $BTC",2025-09-02 22:34:12+00:00,"['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gz3_jGsXcAAiXN8?format=jpg&name=medium', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gz3_at_bAAEX0ur?format=jpg&name=360x360']"
